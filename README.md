Meaning of kotoba

# What

Kotoba aims to provide translation and localization services to your C# applications.
Looking at the current localization options in the .NET ecosystem, we feel like there is a gap, especially compared to
the Java or JavaScript ecosystem.

Kotoba features:

- Integrations with other services to import translations
- Storage layers which can be used to access the imported translations
- Behaviors which define how translations should be kept up to date or refreshed [TODO]
- Helpers that allow you to consume translations in views [TODO]
